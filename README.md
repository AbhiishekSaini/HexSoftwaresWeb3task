# ANIMATINGING WEBSITE

This project demonstrates how to animate a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! The key feature of this website is a dynamic header section that comes to life with smooth CSS animations.

Key Features:
CSS Animations: Multiple elements in the header are animated to create an engaging visual experience.
Animation Timing: Each element has a carefully controlled time delay, allowing for a cascading effect as animations unfold across the site.
Simple and Lightweight: The animations are lightweight, using only CSS for smooth, efficient transitions.
Explore the source code and see how to implement these animation techniques to bring static websites to life!
